			<!-- This introductory line is used so that mousing it over changes all bold words of following paragraph to red text color.-->
			<a href = "#" onMouseOver = "changeToRed()" onMouseOut = "returnToBlack()">
			<br>If you wish to change the text color of <i>all</i> <span style = "font-weight: bold">bold</span> words of the following paragraph to <span style = "color: red; font-weight: bold">red</span>, you can mouse over <i>this line</i>; mouse out from <i>this line</i> returns all of them to <span style = "color: black; font-weight: bold">black</span> color.<br>
			However, should you wish to change the text color of <i>individual</i> <span style = "font-weight: bold">bold</span> words to <span style = "color: red; font-weight: bold">red</span>, simply mouse over <i>that word</i>; mouse out from <i>that word</i> returns it to <span style = "color: black; font-weight: bold">black</span> color.</a>
